Let\'s face it, the world will end one day. Of course, this could happen in about 6 billion years, when the diameter of the Sun will peak in the red giant phase, and will evaporate the Earth\'s atmosphere, the Earth\'s crust and mantle would be removed, leaving only the core. [Fendi case](http://www.nixcase.com/fendi-karlito-iphone-6-plus-case-black-p-5234.html)　　However, we will not see this destructive process, because before the Sun gets bigger, there may also be other factors that lead to human extinction (perhaps all life on the planet).　　Earlier last year, from Sweden global challenge trust researcher and the Oxford future of humanity Institute has published a report, which provides an overview of 12 potential \"infinity effect\" of the global crisis. The author thinks that the impact will be \"human civilizations and even the end of human life.\" In other words, these 12 crisis is likely to lead to the end of the world.　　These include global crisis global epidemiology, ecological collapse, nuclear war, asteroid impacts, and climate change, and so on. This type of research is very difficult, because they\'re too many unknown factors, there is no way to determine what human extinction would be. Nevertheless, the researchers through the data for the next 100-200 years are estimated.　　So, what are the most likely to kill humans?　　According to the global challenges report shows that in the next 100 years, we will have a 10% chance to develop out of human control systems of artificial intelligence. In simple terms, AI does not need humans to flourish. However, this is not a simple matter, in recent years, artificial intelligence experts also predict that, if our strategy properly, smart computers solve more problems than it creates far more problems.　　Noted in the report: \"artificial intelligence is a unique risk, from a positive point of view, it can be easy to solve other crises, so the Super artificial intelligence is also a potential tool. \"In other words, may result in the end of killer robots, or completely harmless.　　In addition, over the next 100 years, humans will have a 5% chance of being destroyed by the global epidemics or nuclear war. If we do nothing, we might in the next 200 years because of climate change and destruction. Also worth noting is that in this report excludes the external influences of manpower cannot be changed, such as gamma rays near the storm will make the Earth in flames (although the probability is not that high), and so on.　　Referred to in this report, the probability of asteroid hitting the Earth is only one out of 10,000. Astronomer Phil Plait in his work, wrote: \"it seems that the whole universe is trying to destroy us. In a sense, the universe is dangerous, but we must take practical practice. We want to enjoy a wide range of time and space, as well as our ability to handle events. ”　　In addition, some lead to human destruction of the Earth that we cannot estimate the possibility of an alien invasion.[![Alt Fendi case]([[3, u\'http://resource.feng.com/resource/h060/h92/img201602031253510.jpg\', \'Report on the global challenge: what is most likely the end of the world?\', \'https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1519/24671067172_cee71d185f_z.jpg\']])](http://www.nixcase.com/fendi-karlito-iphone-6-plus-case-black-p-5234.html)[Article correction]Collection is the collection of 1542 [FENDI iPhone 6 plus](http://cathkidston2015.tumblr.com/post/136381484217/internet-woes) [http://www.nixcase.com/images/large/i6plus/fendi_i6p2223_lrg.jpg](http://www.nixcase.com/images/large/i6plus/fendi_i6p2223_lrg.jpg) Tags: Science and technology And anecdotesIf you need to reprint, you want the E-Mail authorization. annotated \"source Yu Weifeng network\", an unauthorized reprint, lost chapter reprinted, and this website will be held accountable by law!
