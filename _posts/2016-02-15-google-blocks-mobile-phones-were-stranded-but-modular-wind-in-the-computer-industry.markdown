Remember Google\'s Project Ara project? As early as in the year before it put forward the concept of a modular phone, after two years of research and development, this \"Lego phone\" has entered into the second generation prototype stage. But it has been a while ago, Google has been cancelled at the end of Puerto Rico\'s pilot program, which means that the project was shelved for the time being.However, Google is stranded \"blocks mobile phones\", but the modularity of this form lasted well in the computer industry.A few days ago, Acer launched a modular computer \"Revo Build M1-601\", which is a combination of expansion and Windows 10 mainframe computers. Its parts are connected by a magnetic needle and spring of each module, users can increase according to demand hard, sound modules and Wireless charging pad modules, and so on. End of the year, this product will be launched in China, priced at RMB 1999 only.![Alt Google blocks mobile phones were stranded, but modular wind in the computer industry!](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1701/24395697364_9815ca04be_z.jpg)Acer is not the first modular computer manufacturers. At last year\'s CES, and launched a project called Project Christine Thunder snake, and shows the first prototype. The host computer using the modular design of the warehouse, each of which is designed with wireless cable, can connect through a PCI-e interface, whether it is the CPU, graphics card, memory, or hard disk, you can quickly plug installed. Project Christine is responsible for game players, the player can customize according to your needs a game host.In addition to these PC manufacturers, some startups to smell an opportunity.Last July, a consists of 8 young people established Japan startup Kano introduced a computer accessories. It is child-oriented users, so this appearance looks like toy building blocks of computer accessories. Accessories, features a 8GB SD card, keyboard, speakers, power connectors, HDMI interface and mini-USB interface, just an external monitor can work. In addition, the team also developed a Kano OS based on Debian Linux, and Kano Blocks programming environment, you can run Javascript, Python and other procedures. Children not only can assemble a small computer, can use it to learn simple programming. Kano blocks cost $ 119, and has a global release.![Alt Google blocks mobile phones were stranded, but modular wind in the computer industry!](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1640/24908271432_5c9f0113e4_z.jpg)Australia a startup is One of Education launched a modular mix-\"XO-Infinity\" is known as a hybrid, because it can be used as a notebook and tablet computers. Its modular components there are five, including core frames, batteries, cameras, screens, as well as computing and networking chips. And Kano, computer accessories, it also for pupils-users, design style of more children. According to One Education company said, this product will be launched at the end of the preparatory activities, after entering mass production.

Modular concept first originated in the toy building blocks. Building blocks are widely loved by the children, because it will not only cultivate practical ability, can leverage their boundless imagination, making the model you want. Electronics modular benefits here, due to the highly customizable, you can choose according to their needs the processor, memory, storage, display, camera, and so on, and these components have been formed fixed modules, users can easily replace and upgrade.In addition, digital products change very fast, according to Moore\'s law, properties of components to every 18-24 months they would upgrade to 1 time. Module can greatly reduce upgrade cost for users, so that users at the time of purchase, upgrades can be done on demand, spend the least amount of money to buy the most suitable product, which is the core value of the modular product.Although the benefits of modular electronic products, but to fully realize the commercial, also faces many challenges.Take for instance the Google Project Ara project, which was stranded, the official version is due \"permanent magnet\" technical problems, cell phones cannot drop-tested, so I had to postpone the launch time. In addition to fall without the reason, there are compatibility, standardization, and more problems.Smartphone product modular still remains to be seen, and in computer products, too. Just think, when large modular computer products flood the market, the results may result in users will buy a computer, and then for a long period of time, consumer updates from previous demand to replace the machine into a single module replacement. Manufacturers benefit from a whole profit into profit for a single module, for brand manufacturers and OEM vendors, this will be a huge impact.After Acer introduction this modular computer and netizens ridicule, \"already installed computer city is modular, and can change how you want to change, like how to upgrade just to upgrade.\" Indeed, if the computers after the realization of standard modules, computer city rely on small shops fear born of assembled computers.![Alt Google blocks mobile phones were stranded, but modular wind in the computer industry!](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1605/24999984806_7aefd38987_z.jpg)As you can see, several companies mentioned, Kano and One user Education is for children, and lightning snake are higher requirements on the hardware configuration of the game user-oriented, they are intended for a niche audience, so too many interests and not touched. Acer is consumer-oriented, the short run will win some consumers, but in the long run, or will damage the interests of themselves and their partners. [Mine personnel positioning system solutions](http://www.everweek.com/blog/2016/02/mine-personnel-positioning-system-solutions/)Modular will have a certain demand for computer products, but universal access will be very difficult, because it involves more than just products, are more likely to be revolution in the computer industry as a whole.
