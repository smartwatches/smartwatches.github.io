People are surprised that this is from the hand of Ive. He said, this is the optimal choice in action.6, Apple had been considering the introduction of big screen iPhone 4Apple took some time to get on the road to big-screen phone, the Ive\'s argument, before the large screen phones, Apple had considered building big-screen phones.

But Ive disagreed with the idea, because of the cheap or vision. However, the programme does not seem to be completely killed.13, Apple Watch is a rectangle is not technology problemsApple Watch are rectangular not for technical reasons but, Ive thought a circular table without much practical. Because of the need to present a select list, it is clear that rectangular than circular.14, Apple Watch store renovationApple\'s retail business executive Angela Ahrendts must be completed before the sale at Apple Watch store design and decoration. This does not mean that it needs significant renovation, however, Apple believes that sells high-end watch Apple Watch need not the same experience.15, Apple Watch than any Apple product are belong to the IveAccording to Williams (on the Toyota Camry), Ive watch this project met with some resistance.
