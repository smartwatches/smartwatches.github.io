Beaver at first glance, you might think it\'s not a very efficient company. Whether it\'s nail beauty Eyelash, or a new line of beauty services, no standard price range. Craftsman ratings vary, enter each artisan\'s page, like entering the store to a different style, sometimes it takes some time to phase one for yourself.　　In addition, each artisan orders nor according to the system location optimization them a route directly sent to crafts people.　　And efficient Uber, emphasizing social Airbnb are not the same, as a take on the supply side and the demand side of the seesaw, what do Beavers incentive platform thousands of crafts people.　　Beauty nail itself decided to order range　　In the case of business and management, there is such an old story, in 1560, Switzerland watchmakers Booker in the preview at the pyramid, made an unconventional concluded that pyramid is the joy of freedom created by the people, rather than Herodotus as recorded in history--built by 300,000 slaves.　　Such an inference was as a laughingstock, a watchmaker by something negative in ancient Greece famous writer Herodotus?　　Booker in light of its own experience and gives this explanation:　　In 1536, the Booker against the Holy Canon was sentenced, during her captivity, he was making clocks, the watchmaker has one second can easily make errors less than 100 per cent of the clock, while in prison, no matter what pressure means, he made no errors even less than one-tenth seconds of the clock.　　Booker later escaped back to lead a free life, he produced watches level back all over again. He then write down this word:　　\"A clockmaker in dissatisfaction and anger, to successfully complete watches and clocks of 1200 processes, is impossible. Such a vast project of the pyramid was built so fine, all aspects are its so seamlessly, the Builder must be a pious heart free. Hard to imagine that a slave of laches and aggressive behavior, and absolutely impossible to get between the stones of the pyramid of even a small piece of blade chime in. 」　　400 years later, Booker inferred by archaeologists proved to be entirely correct, pyramid is by local farmers and craftsmen built with free status.　　This case was later used in enterprise management, shed light on the importance of freedom.　　At the crest of a beaver on the platform, it is easy to feel the air of freedom. Each process themselves to choose their own service provider, select income options, select any number.　　![Alt O2O beauty industry platform to inspire artisans](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1556/25158573095_75bac623af_b.jpg) 　　At the earliest in nail services, doing nails for me sister in 798 Nan Yuan to pick up even more after you complete a form to another form. Sounds too not too weird.　　In this regard, the Beaver song Chao, Deputy Chief of public relations is not surprising.　　\"We are not geographically based nail technician dispatches, each nail in our platform can choose their own service business, if the CCP is a manicurist to select EON and Zhongguancun, that she can only see international orders for and Zhongguancun, see other shopping districts. 」 [Video sites lack hematopoietic 2016 will survive](http://www.hubgold.com/2015/11/28/video-sites-lack-hematopoietic-2016-will-survive-the-tough/)　　Those just getting started form enough nail, often choose to select business as much as possible, so that you can keep your more likely to be found.　　As the number of orders increased, taking into account transportation costs, manicurist will close some, choose from their homes near the shopping district.　　And when the manicurist\'s ratings increased after the price increase, some will again expand their business to attract more high quality and high price of the order.　　Are selected by the manicurist yourself throughout the process.　　If the manicurist, and beauticians are thought of as a store, in addition to their outside stores lots of business, they can store their own \"decoration\".　　Beavers do not provide standard photos, on the contrary, it encourages arts and crafts people to upload his works. 19 years old, small for this specialized bought us mobile phone, just to take pictures look good. Manicurist sunset or making your own business cards, finish nail to every customer.　　Set the star, providing goal-driven incentives　　Beauty is home to Beavers in April this year has just launched a new project, O2O in the beauty industry in this huge market, Beaver\'s competitors are not just small beauty home, beauty Director of special project, and pretty said, e-commerce shopping platform. According to Yao Wenjing, Director of Beaver beauty line introduced, Beaver beauty project is 50% within 30 days after purchase.　　\"Our product is not so perfect, real stickiness is fulfilled by artisans on the platform. 」 [Video sites lack hematopoietic 2016 will survive](http://www.hubgold.com/2015/11/28/video-sites-lack-hematopoietic-2016-will-survive-the-tough/)　　In daily chemical industry for many years Yao Wenjing the beauty industry has done a lot of research and found that in addition to the large international brand chain stores, there are lots of little traditional beauty salon lines are not operating problems. Truly and skin effect related to the artisan way, throughout the system, only takes up a small part of it.　　![Alt O2O beauty industry platform to inspire artisans](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1554/25065320941_f9154d6101_b.jpg) 　　So, they think of repricing. From the cost of beauty products, artisans of the time cost, transportation cost in three dimensions for each salon services pricing.　　Among them, the craftsmen of different star, time is not the same to award star, Yao Wenjing said they also walk a detour.　　\"At first we assess each star beautician skills link, later found that the level of skill and artisan of singular, acclaim does not directly associated. Beautician services, marketing ability, ability to communicate with customers will have an impact. Then we joined the satisfaction received more dimensions to set a different star. 」　　Beavers also star Manicurist, celebrity hairdresser this honorary title, creating a progressive layers of hierarchy.　　Honor Rewards is only one aspect, beavers will also stimulate the craftspeople more in subsidized form, only completed a single volume can only be subsidized.　　\"It and drops the subsidies is not the same, our user behavior is much more complex, subsidies no dust unchanged patterns. Beaver\'s platform now has 49, 29 low price order, also normal order. Sometimes we price subsidies in order, encouraged the artisans more lists like this, sometimes placed on a normal list of subsidies. In this way, our craftsmen can guide the user to consume different beauty products. But the overall objective is to attract new customers and retain existing customers. 」　　Just like Taobao, when on the platform each artisan to develop their initiative, both supply and demand are at the ends of the seesaw fly easily.
