Introduction: arm accidentally broken, in order to recover, have to hard plaster, hanging a thick bandage. Traditional treatment method has two main disadvantages: bad cleaning, skin tight. Winter clothing inconvenience, sweltering in the summer, when no injury to pick?![Alt 3D printing support: mothers no longer have to worry about my broken](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1537/25887709655_5376b37bc0_z.jpg)Fracture of 3DScott Summit\'s arm was injured, needed six-month rehabilitation period. He Bespoke served as design Director for 3D printing company (the company\'s main supports and prosthesis print business), Summit used the opportunity to design a 3D printing support.\"The best part is that 3D printing development space has a wide range of possibilities, just like in 1997, the 3D printing can be extended to all aspects of: space, art, fashion, dental care, everything you can imagine. We realize that health care is a very big market, each individual has the particularity of this field does not have a \' one size fits all \' solution. ”Eventually, Scott Summit arm is 3D scanning, print out the parts it can fixed arm through three core points, three point hold the palms, in which slowly repaired ligaments. Because it is just a frame, so it won\'t completely encased arm ensures breathability and flexibility. Also, the stand only 5 mm thick, looks or even a rehabilitation tool, like a work of art.Summit, \"said products not only for doctors from a cast of trouble, make patients feel the benefits of light. Can\'t say this is the best solution, but at least provides a solution that is better than the usual. ”This approach has also been recognized by doctors. Wearing this bracket, Summit can shower as usual, but can also hurt the creams--it used to be unthinkable. Even, he can keep the dress as usual.![Alt 3D printing support: mothers no longer have to worry about my broken](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1488/25258990543_75d8a5f6b8_z.jpg)Wearing 3D printing support showerHowever, because it is their products, Summit has not told Fast Company the support cost. \"Seven years ago, when we imagine d print way to solve this problem, it is almost absurd and unthinkable. But now, we have confirmed that it is not impossible, and it is even more expensive than traditional treatments work. ”Editor\'s comments: is a 3D technology innovation in medical devices, humans accidentally fractures the time before is always wrapped in thick layers of plaster, very inconvenient. This bracket is fracture of 3D beauty accidentally fractures of the Gospel.  [On computer vision start up this traditional company](http://www.everweek.com/blog/2016/02/on-computer-vision-start-up-this-traditional-company-will-give-you-a-lot-of/)  [On computer vision start up this traditional company](http://www.everweek.com/blog/2016/02/on-computer-vision-start-up-this-traditional-company-will-give-you-a-lot-of/)
