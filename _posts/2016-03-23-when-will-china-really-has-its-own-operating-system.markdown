\"The country wants to have its own operating system, at least 20, and Korea cooperate for so many years, this is reasonable? ” [Marcelo Burlon iPhone 6 Plus Cases](https://www.ssense.com/en-us/men/product/marcelo-burlon-county-of-milan/black-slim-stone-jeans/1382423) [http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/i6plus/marcelo_burlon_i6p1905_lrg.jpg](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/i6plus/marcelo_burlon_i6p1905_lrg.jpg) 　　On the mobile operating system, and computer operating system, strictly speaking, aside a change out of Android\'s cloud system, it really does not have its own research and development operating system. Computer systems have a \"Unicorn\" system is also strongly supported from the State, while the system itself is the Linux kernel. Today does not tell you whether this is reasonable, I simply said why the operating system delays?　　Domestic strength, want an OS is definitely out, this is not to say that no programmer will write to problems, but the most fundamental problem \"thankless\"　　Operating system is relatively difficult to write a program, doesn\'t mean that no one can write it, don\'t say \"flowers\", is to develop a complete set of operating systems in the world are few. Don\'t go to research and development, is called, simply, for several reasons, one of which is the cost too high, write a complete operating system and time-consuming effort, consuming 35, for more than 10 years of research and development to develop a set of operating system out there will have better results.　　And new of company no history, and experience of accumulated, is easy in this above detours, so so years early large funds of input brings of returns also is uncertainty of, no which company will to stupid to do this pieces thing, even Google this behemoth, development Android of when is based on Linux and GNU of supporting tool, and not from in to outside completely himself to research development.[![Alt Marcelo Burlon iPhone 6 Plus Cases]([[1, u\'http://resource.feng.com/resource/h059/h98/img201509171212220.jpg\', \'When will China really has its own operating system?\', \'https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1655/25870976992_38f9a7642c_b.jpg\']])](http://www.nodcase.com/marcelo-burlon-iphone-6-plus-case-wolf-black-p-4765.html)　　More than 10 years of time commitment does not necessarily make money, values does not let domestic companies and programmers, who would not look abroad to do it. After all, who is not a fool, and companies will have earnings, money does not just play money burning.　　The second reason is that without a good ecological chain　　Whether mobile operating system or the operating system on the PC side, is the need to give users, then needed a complete eco-environment, when new operating systems are developed, if second ten blocks will have other operating system users to use, the key is to have several new companies to patting his chest that I developed systems will be able to kill Microsoft? If you develop a system like Windows 98, backward Win10 n long, is Win10 seconds do not know in all directions, so who is going to use your operating system?　　If you make a similar system, the most important thing is the software, no software who will use the new system? First, low visibility, fewer users, users who would have to go to this new system development software less, without the support of a variety of software systems is what yo? It will make the user less, under this kind of infinite loop, even old feelings of course still have to die. Go ahead for this reason dead system and still struggling for a company wants to do the operating system blood reminder.　　The third reason is useless　　This is not to say that development of the new system is not necessary, is necessary for development of a new system, but because for all of these reasons, even if developed, want to get market recognition is very difficult, market recognition software still needs to slowly increase the number of supported by the new system, China took IT, there are a few companies can afford the energy consumption? Even Microsoft, WP does all these years, do not still struggling? For these IT companies, development of new operating systems there is no need to. There is no reason to.　　So what\'s left, the State has used to support domestic enterprises to develop a new operating system, but the result? Things to come out of a person ended up getting the money, there is that point road. Not worth mentioning.　　In the current environment, in the absence of good soils support, let alone 20 years, another 50 years is like this, after all, businessmen are profit.[Article correction]Collection is the collection of 1542 [Marcelo Burlon iPhone 6 Plus Cases](http://www.nodcase.com/marcelo-burlon-iphone-6-plus-case-wolf-black-p-4765.html)Tags: Internet Science and technology
