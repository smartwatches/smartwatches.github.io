During the World Cup in 2014, many Agency data to predict the result, during the Spring Festival last year, Baidu Union out CCTV Spring Festival migration figure.　　China is a populous country, revolves around a variety of holiday economy, the tourism industry growing, but when Golden weeks will encounter various attractions are overcrowded and road congestion is to let the people immensely. Although a variety of institutions in the use of your data for analysis, to contribute to the ease of passenger tourist attractions, but it is always difficult to have a substantial effect. To analyze the reasons, mainly because the General institutions of the data is not comprehensive or real-time immediate information collected from all visitors.　　In reality, there is a big data applications is in a unique position, that is, communication operators. Operators have hundreds of millions of communications user base to ensure that the data massive and pluralism, sustainability of these data, operators can through the analysis of massive amounts of data accurately and efficiently providing products and services to customers and the community. [Tiger nose micro groups micro business and media](http://www.hubgold.com/2016/02/12/tiger-nose-micro-groups-micro-business-and-media-how-active-in-villages-and/)　　For example, communication operators has for many years been in the full collection user communications using information from all sides, including personal background information, real-time mobile user location information, now you can also get more mobile Internet applications, as long as it is properly used, entirely possible to give clear and precise analysis of walking routes, travel preferences, and so on, into a model for big data applications.　　In this respect, there are already internationally successful applications. According to media reports, United States carriers Verizon companies in one of the Super Bowl audience analysis, within a short time you can get the user\'s behavior to predict traffic conditions in and after the concert, as the basis of the transport sector, and achieved satisfactory results. For example, information that in the Super Bowl Stadium, from Baltimore to three times times the number of fans from San Francisco, this data is difficult to obtain through other channels, operators are easy.　　Internally, some operators have already carried out a similar study on the application of large data, and gradually began to show great prospects. For example, some operators of some scenic spots in the province covered by the network signaling for data extraction, combined with analysis of cloud computing engines, standing in the data perspective, for practitioners of tourism authorities and travel-related industries decision provides first-hand data and operational planning support.　　As tourism competent sector, and travel agency or scenic management party, most concern of is nothing more than is four a problem: visitors from where to? visitors how to? visitors to which play? visitors how play? to wants to solution this four a problem, on must master visitors of action track information, but visitors in all institutions fill in of form information is limited and does not necessarily by plans implementation, family and the friends with free line of visitors more is whereabouts difficult find. At this time, only able to staff a mobile can help here.　　According to reports, big data applications in practice, every tourist has a cell phone, even if the user is not the operator, can also be informed through the communication of data between network analysis, therefore, through surveys of visitor number attribution, gets visitors source information, including the province, provincial or foreign, can clearly lists the major tourists belonging to tourism. Operator action tracking to visiting tourists, including a transport hub, including railway stations, airports and other records, comprehensive analysis of visitor movement than to, can restore the tourists reached way, such as by road, rail or air. Real time traffic statistics through the attractions, that daily passenger flow trend chart, peaked and give visitors statistics, to sound area safety early-warning mechanisms, early Act safeguards. Through the arrivals continued tracking, statistics in a single area within the play longer, and tourists upstream and downstream locations, daily play fine, features regional analysis into tourism path, so that tourism authorities and related practitioners to develop a more personalized tour packages for visitors, provide catering, accommodation, entertainment service. (Here to reference some operators of tourism data of relevant information) [Tiger nose micro groups micro business and media](http://www.hubgold.com/2016/02/12/tiger-nose-micro-groups-micro-business-and-media-how-active-in-villages-and/)　　In addition, operators can also be combined with large data applications and providing electronic services for tourist and visitors Guide, visitors to scenic areas then proactively pushed to visitors to scenic descriptions, consumer reminded, you can also monitor the performance of travel agencies, effective monitoring low price shopping missions against the interests of consumers.　　Of course, the operator\'s data was not perfect, on the data also needs to be added, if Internet companies that travel and tourism services cooperation, will be able to provide more data dimensions, also for employees in the tourism agencies and ordinary people have more realistic values.
