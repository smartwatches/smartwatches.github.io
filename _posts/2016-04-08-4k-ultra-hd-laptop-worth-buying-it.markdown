As technology advances, laptop display resolution and higher, more and more pixels. However, these ultra high-resolution laptop whether it is really worth to buy?　　In most cases, a 4K ultra HD laptop looks absolutely gorgeous, but that does not mean that it is very practical. In fact, 4K laptop is facing many problems, including lack of expensive, 4K content, such as power consumption. Therefore, since before 1080p laptop upgrade to 4K laptop, users should be carefully considered.![Alt 4K ultra HD laptop worth buying it?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1574/26296681165_1f87091605_z.jpg)　　Visual recognition ability is limited　　For clarity purposes, 4K performance certainly is far better than the 1080p of the screen display, and 4K technology is the trend in coming years. At present, more and more devices of all shapes and sizes began to use 4K display, but the problem is our recognition rate there is a limit to the naked eye, no benefit since some devices 4K.![Alt 4K ultra HD laptop worth buying it?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1546/26204252582_045c57bb59_z.jpg)　　As far as the resolution, most people will agree that higher pixel density will definitely bring us a much clearer picture. However, the United States Bryan Jones, Research Assistant Professor of ophthalmology at the University of Utah, said, our rate is limited by the naked eye, not increased with increasing pixel density to increase.　　Bryan Jones said: \"If you were sitting in front of a display of 30 inches or more, your binocular Visual acuity is 1.0, which means that you can distinguish the highest pixel density is 220ppi. Once the screen\'s pixel density than 220ppi, they simply do not exist for you. ”　　However, prior to the market\'s longest laptop screen size of 13.3-inch and 15.6-inch. In the case of this size, 60ppi based on pixel density in the 220ppi to 110ppi. Under normal circumstances, those extra pixels are difficult to be perceived by the naked eye by users unless you sit very close. Bryan Jones points out: \"If your eyesight is not perfect, or you sit too far away from the screen, you can tell the highest pixel density may be lower, and may be as low as 90ppi. In addition, a good screen and not just depend on the ultra high resolution, brightness, contrast, color fidelity and will affect the display viewing angle is good or bad. ”　　Power consumption![Alt 4K ultra HD laptop worth buying it?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1577/25691824224_3fdd3ec988_z.jpg)　　Laptop and the main reason is that their mobility, which means they consume battery power. If you need to regularly participate in meetings, or need for outdoor Office, battery life for you will be a key factor.　　However, the 4K laptop has power problems, screen pixel density, the higher the greater the consumption of electricity. In order to drive a higher-resolution screen, 4K notebook is equipped with a power higher and better performance of discrete graphics, which will increase the power consumption. [Strategies of the operators lost Internet times](http://www.szbuzz.com/2016/04/03/strategies-of-the-operators-lost-internet-times-three-is-so-similar/)　　For laptops, which is the maximum value of portability, if the battery does not have super long battery life, portability will become \"empty talk\". Therefore, sacrifice battery life for 4K resolution of the naked eye cannot be identified, can be said to be worth the candle. [Strategies of the operators lost Internet times](http://www.szbuzz.com/2016/04/03/strategies-of-the-operators-lost-internet-times-three-is-so-similar/)　　According to the previous test, using MSI GS60 3K resolution screen Ghost Pro Gaming battery life only in about 2 hours, and Super HD Toshiba Satellite P50T laptop battery is only for 2 hours 40 minutes. Compared to 1080p display laptop 4K laptop battery life will be much shorter.　　4K limited![Alt 4K ultra HD laptop worth buying it?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1551/25691835964_b923156d53_z.jpg)　　As with 4K, 4K laptop is also facing a lack of problems. Although Blu-ray players can convert a 1080p movie 4K movie, but they are not the real 4K. Currently, Netflix is increasing its 4K content, but 4K movie requires excellent broadband bandwidth for streaming media support, that is, stable Internet access speeds of 25Mbps, and it\'s hard for many consumers.　　At present, the 4K available for watching video content is very rare, and more are showing small pieces of 4K resolution. Perhaps, 4K video in the near future will be the same like 1080p video to quickly expand the number. However, the current 4K from Netflix or Amazon Prime Instant video content is only compatible TV, cannot play in the laptop. If you want to watch on 4K laptop 4K content of the movie, then you will be disappointed.　　Expensive![Alt 4K ultra HD laptop worth buying it?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1455/25691841894_556c4a47e5_z.jpg)　　Compared with the 1080p laptop 4K laptop costs a lot more expensive. For example, 1080p Dell XPS 13 version sells for $ 999 (about 6387), 4K price is $ 1299 for Dell XPS 13 (about RMB 8305). Similarly, 1080p 2015, Thunder snake Blade starts at $ 1999 (about 12780 Yuan), while 4K 2015 Thunder snake Blade starts at $ 2399 (about RMB 15340).　　Best buying opportunity![Alt 4K ultra HD laptop worth buying it?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1528/26023845150_51de5c5ac6_z.jpg)　　The question now is, 4K laptop when fit to buy? for example, photographers need a 4K laptop, in order to better quality control to take its own pictures? of course, 4K will display high resolution benefit photographers, but photographer not only requires high resolution, also require precise color calibration, high resolution alone was not enough.　　So, 4K notebook computer whether for video edit who does? consider to more more more more of camera began support 4K video of shooting, even some high-end phone also began support 4K video of shooting, has a Taiwan 4K notebook computer certainly will let video edit work more found, but while also exists not small of obstacles, for example you must has a super big of hard disk, because 4K video may will soon on will fill you of 1TB hard disk.　　Gaming prospects　　Perhaps, 4K HD might be the best 4K laptop at this stage of the game ending. In fact, resolution is larger than the 1080p of masterpiece PC games have become commonplace, with the high-end video cards like the NVIDIA Titan x, implementation of 4K game is a cinch.　　Of course, this also means that the video card will be a lot of pressure, for example, if you set the resolution of the game to 3200x1800, even though Super notebook like the 2015 Edition Thunder snake Razer, are only able to maintain 10fps run frames, but these obstacles could be overcome with the development of graphics performance.　　Summary　　Laptop\'s advantage lies in its relatively small display can be used as the 4K carrier of content consumption, but this advantage is clearly very difficult to make up for their price, battery life, lack of 4K content deficiencies. For consumers who care about budget or striving for perfection, 4K laptop is clearly not worth buying at this stage.
