As part of the ecological chain of millet, Yeelight recent updates on my second generation of product, different from the previous generation, this generation of Yeelight more common WiFi connection, than the first generation closer to the life of the product. Today we take a look at Yeelight white version there is nothing different about it.

Compared to Yeelight, second generation supports millet router, more general other routers through the millet of intelligent home control App.![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1455/25742930794_524bd0f8d2_b.jpg)After you remove the protective plastic bag, we see the Yeelight second generation phenomenon.![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1511/26281578631_6c13ec4675_b.jpg)Same as the previous generation, Yeelight second generation still uses a Lotus-like shape, white acrylic shade at the top, the main part is made of aluminum alloy changed to common plastic material. To a usually inconspicuous items like light bulbs, aluminum alloy shell of negligible significance.![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1516/26347815555_5369f23976_b.jpg)Back is the electrical parameters. E27 screw is also needless to say, the most common lamp screw.[![Alt disney](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/apple_case/disney_mi667_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/disney-mickey-mouse-ipad-mini-leather-case-for-ipad-mini-1-2-3-p-4926.html)As regards work, between plastic body and acrylic shade gap is still a little big, but there will not be the first generation product of metal cutting and cutting his hand problems.Operation and use![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1592/26281593641_9d0d9565b8_b.jpg)Yeelight with WiFi connectivity and support other routers are second generation than previous generations to use many bulbs after installing, open home App on the phone will automatically search for Yeelight and prompt to connect, we only need to set the bulb connection WiFi can be used. Of course, if you do not set can also be used just like ordinary light bulbs, 100% by default display brightness white.![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1662/25745057923_3b42edceea_b.jpg)Due to the Yeelight second generation no longer change color functions, so the App interface is simple and a lot. Lights under bright yellow and white, turn off the lights then the starry night sky background. Lighting State can slide up and down to adjust light brightness, theoretically, 100 level adjustment.If you want to adjust, you can also click on the lower right of the \"my\" enter custom brightness mode, preset brightness, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, six options, infant mode and reading mode. In the main interface after you adjust the brightness, click on lower right corner of the save the asterisk to a custom list.25% brightness75% brightness100% brightnessThree different brightness mode, Yeelight light adjustment soft brightness changes over gently, do not appear suddenly become bright or harsh situations.ExperienceYeelight II and finally increase the timing light and delay off lights design, just a little complicated. Click on the menu button in the upper right, click delay to turn off the light, but that\'s not enough, we want to set again, click set time-delay to turn off the lights, and then slide up and down to adjust the time, turning off lights to complete the delayed presets, indeed somewhat tedious.Timing lights on only in \"smart\" setting, you first need to enter the \"smart\" interface, and set the time, and then set the lamp operation, also need to manually open after saving strategies, also slightly cumbersome.But the \"intelligent scene\" is not useless, we can preset combinations of switches on the light to suit your needs, such as timing lights, turn off the lights. We can also name the WiFi you are connected automatically at the company or at home, thus camera corresponding intelligent strategy (for a sister who are afraid of the dark, go downstairs after the mobile phone connected to their WiFi automatically, lights illuminate, a little warm, but still). On the degree of intelligence than the previous generation of products has been greatly improved.In addition to these, Yeelight can also form a set policy, you can also share the device with his family.SummaryUsing Bluetooth-WiFi connection are no longer subject to recognition, also can be used for all the routers, router is no longer millet\'s exclusive, scope greatly increased. Second Yeelight second generation adds delay to turn off the lights and timing lights function and customizable \"smart policy\" policy can be customized to control switch of the lamp, don\'t always have to come up with mobile phone App control, usability has increased tremendously.Yeelight second generation is still not perfect, slightly cumbersome one time switch lights, we also met during the testing process after switching power supplies, bulbs are unable to connect, have to reset bulb reconnect to WiFi, since we are in the hands of a machine engineering, unable to determine if the case is common.Despite the above problems, but afterward, compared to the second generation Yeelight generation has made a lot of progress, though there is no color change function, but has made a lot of progress on the functionalities and compatibility, devices that no longer is of no practical significance. Just being a no color-changing feature not cool cool \"incandescent\" bulb prices are still slightly higher.Recommended related articlesThe rich willful faith-filled, millet Yeelight intelligent lights review17 votes [disney](http://www.nodcase.com/disney-mickey-mouse-ipad-mini-leather-case-for-ipad-mini-1-2-3-p-4926.html)Yeelight intelligent light bulbs\rLast year into millet millet company smart home is overwhelming and, if memory serves, first home accessories is yeelight smart bulbs, smart concept is that in order to keep the bulb of the lamp hold has a different color, different colors in different environment and allow everyone to feel the joy of different colors\rView details of the voting >>
