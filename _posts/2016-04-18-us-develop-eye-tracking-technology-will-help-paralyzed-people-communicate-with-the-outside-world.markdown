People suffering from atresia syndrome is completely isolated from the outside world. They are paralyzed, unable to move or speak--in many cases, they may only have eyes these are under the control of its own. Lucky is that technology will probably use patients left it free to help them voice. According to the United States Engadget (Engadget) reported on August 9, United States, University of California, San Diego, researchers are developing a system, this system can be implemented using eye-tracking communication.　　 [The Internet based on who was the key innovation](https://galaxyscreens.wordpress.com/2016/03/29/the-internet-based-on-who-was-the-key-innovation-operators-flow-obstacles/)![Alt Us develop eye-tracking technology will help paralyzed people communicate with the outside world](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1577/26445838221_4369991a35_z.jpg) 　　The school\'s Research Institute has released the Eyehome prototypes. Patients can gaze at a similar mobile device interface to manipulate different parts of the screen. Patients can look in a certain direction to oral information, look in the other direction to see social network. In addition to dedicated e-book reader, even a command only with the eyes of musical instruments.　　However, research is still at an early stage. Study it formally started last fall, and at the University of California, San Diego research team was recently awarded a $ 300,000 investment, which helps to make efforts to come true. But now that we have a prototype, this indicates that patients with atresia Syndrome will soon be independent.
