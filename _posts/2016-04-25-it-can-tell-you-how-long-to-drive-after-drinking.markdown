But we still continue to hear and even entertainment, administrative circle of dignitaries have been drunk driving trouble, led to scenes of accidents, large and small. Then again, drunk driving is a completely unnecessary things, in the car and the driver market maturing today, in any case without so much of a risk to drinking and driving. Problem is that drunk, who could then sensible analysis, drunkard in a \"I\'m not drunk,\" State of thought cycling Super God. In that case, we can only rely on external environmental forces to prevent drunk driving, the DADSS alcohol detection system might be able to help a lot, although DADSS can\'t tell you how much alcohol to drive, but it can tell you exactly how long after drinking can drive, the answer is the drivers \' blood alcohol content less than 0.08%.DADSS alcohol detection systems![Alt It can tell you how long to drive after drinking!](http://katespadeiphonecase.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/7836d267.jpeg)DADSS (Driver Alcohol Detection System) alcohol-detection system consists of two parts, the breathing part is mounted above the steering wheel-monitoring system, covering the entire drive area, continuing to test motorists breath alcohol content of gases, while ignoring the rest of the passengers expelled air.Part II was integrated on the Start button, through the skin-contact infrared sensors, you press the auto start button quickly concluded that the blood alcohol level for a short time. Officials said the inspection lasted less than a second.![Alt It can tell you how long to drive after drinking!](http://katespadeiphonecase.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/783c99d7.jpeg)Any one of the two parts, if results of the test results revealed that the driver\'s blood alcohol concentration is greater than 0.08%, cars will be forced to fail to start.

Another 15 companies expressed support for the development team. DADSS systems as options integrated in the car in the future, is expected to be the biggest culprits of traffic accidents caused by drunk driving a major blow, this is certainly a good news. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DagdfMAMp84](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DagdfMAMp84) Development agency United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA for short) that the system will be in production within 5 years. However, we still did not find DADSS system more technical details, such as contact-how do infrared sensors for detecting blood alcohol content? In addition, drivers who wear gloves, or called someone else start the car, this expensive system can also play a role?For more cool intelligent hardware information, please pay attention to odd public number (woaiqiku), in odd public key, you can buy, and I\'m not gonna tell you, register as a network of Lei Feng (search for \"Lei feng\'s network\", public interest) members can obtain the benefits of super well.![Alt It can tell you how long to drive after drinking!](http://katespadeiphonecase.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/78398ac6.jpeg)7 votesDADSS alcohol detection systems\rDrunkard in a \"I\'m not drunk,\" State of thought cycling Super God.
