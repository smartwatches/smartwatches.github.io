And the most important thing is the difference user groups, ZUK real target is two or three lines after the city\'s 95 young people, mainly students.　　Here do not speak of specific products, said after the interview with Chang Cheng 10 referred to in detail, you can see a published site not the same side, PS. didn\'t think Chang Cheng Chi morning post reader, greeting is, \"dude you tired?\" ：　　, Magic workshop is a Lenovo veteran restructuring team?　　Employees allegedly magical workshop, has from the very beginning of Lenovo employees, and great changes have taken place.

Chang Cheng was later, Yang yuanqing, Xudong Chen, all in the United States hold shareholders meeting, but then again, that is in itself a horn show, even if Lenovo executives, which is in the audience holding off, but then he is said to have also a wish on Twitter had doubled.　　Second, cell phones other than going to, do wear product.　　In earliest Association founded a team when magic workshop, is not a mobile phone brands and companies.

The argument is given, while Shenzhen has many overseas distributors, meanwhile, feel that it is \"small producers\", but the overseas scheme, reportedly does not include Taiwan.　　ZUK oversea the plan from the outset, another reason why, and is backed by the Association to take Lenovo\'s channel advantage in strong overseas.　　Four, ZUK-oriented, which group of people　　Media believe that Chang Cheng language after the speaker released today is 95, ZUK is which group? can be summarized simply as third-tier cities, groups of students, mostly after 95, \"hormones can\'t release, mind and build their own brand of things\", this is Chang Cheng\'s description of this group of people.　　Also, this user focused more on QQ platform, in particular groups, although for older users, app using the threshold is lower, but it focused more on platforms such as QQ Group after group 95, according to Chang Cheng his core audience has more than 1800 people.　　Five, what difference　　Magic workshop where is the difference, even if the product release, and it\'s hard to tell, whether it\'s UI design, ICON painting, still features such as fingerprint identification, U-Touch differences have made it difficult for all. Chang Cheng think the difference here is in the \"about this group of users. \"Concrete is in the community, social and brand on the shape of the product itself.　　Six, why are OEM BYD　　As ZUK\'s first product, the Z1 BYD is looking for OEM, BYD electronic OEM business is one of its three major business segments, once worked for brands such as Nokia, HTC Foundry. Why not choose associate Department of resources?　　Chang Cheng about the thinking behind, on the one hand last year to now, internationalization of Lenovo\'s focus is more on Motorola phones, too busy to take into account, on the other hand, as an independent brand, and external partners is a good thing.　　Seven, ZUK now can be regarded as at least one network brand [All the raised legend Pebble Smart Watch reviews](http://www.szbuzz.com/2016/06/13/all-the-raised-legend-pebble-smart-watch-reviews/)　　Now ZUK channel sales program, ZUK really can be seen as a network brand.　　Main sales channel is the main network to be considered, in addition to the website, is the first on the East platform, after being launched on other platforms. When it comes to offline channels plan, Chang Cheng says, at least after next year.　　![Alt Phone magic workshop conference don\'t see 10 on the side](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7128/27439814420_15f681828e.jpg) 　　Eight, the Z1 the most satisfactory?　　While the concept of using 10 stories in series a whole new, but on the phone, which in the end is the most satisfactory? often drive the answer is \"do the 64GB price. \"It seems that value for money although there is no reference to, this is ZUK hope that through this kind of mobile phone do, from this point of view, ZUK is a bit like early phone is also intended for a younger audience, cost-effective, but millet in the play known as the\" heavy users \"group, ZUK was thinking, younger users.　　Nine, of runaway CEO why cry?　　Referred to the Conference final and in the user\'s communication\'s \"trust\" topic, often drive lost control of his emotions, face crying, so hurriedly announced the price, this is why?　　This Chang Cheng said that there was a moment of feeling, if statements are used to talk about trust, inevitably sentimental, but specific details were, Chang Cheng is said to have a core user 19 user group, the company is no secret plans, products, and 1 month before this group of users has started playing.　　Who is ten, ZUK target opponent?　　ZUK\'s right should be the label which manufacturers? often drive there is no concrete answer to tell you this, but said an attitude is \"tearing forces\", can also be seen in the publishing process, which opponents didn\'t go out and PK, more calm and restraint of his own plays.　　Should be more clear brand, will have this mentality, the same State of mind, one plus one can feel on the launch of generation 2. And of a most testy is millet, music video, 360 as the Internet brand, no fights, no sense of place.　　That is about all.　　Finally, the choice of mobile phone to do this category, Chang Cheng said, and said again, or choose a mobile phone also believes that mobile phone manufacturers in China are worthy of respect, from the development trend of Apple, Samsung, mobile phone market focus of the future belongs to China.　　Another point is, select phone, is also an original sin, think Lenovo Mobile does not currently have a number of opponents, and its responsibility; where you fall, from where to stand up.
