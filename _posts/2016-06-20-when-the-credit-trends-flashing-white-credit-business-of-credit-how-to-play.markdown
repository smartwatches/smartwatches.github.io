In June, the State opening of consumer finance companies, the original pilot consumer finance companies in the 16 cities expand to the whole country to encourage eligible private capital, domestic and foreign banking institutions and Internet companies initiated the establishment of a consumer financial company. Consumer finance has received national attention, and include such Internet giants as Ali and Jing dong, as well as numerous start-up companies are targeting this area, introduced the respective credit on credit products.　　Consumer finance, \"threshold\" of entrepreneurship　　\"For the purposes of e-commerce, consumer finance, we believe that the threshold is still relatively high. \"Flash white CEO Sheng Yang Ti media editor says. He was referring to barriers including difficulties with these two: the first is data mining. Data for a single e-commerce might be a data island. Because a consumer data does not reflect the full electrical contractor users the entire credit system and portraits. In addition, the lack of willingness of large data mining, because, for them, the more hope in supply chain management, and user experience and service to be more professional.　　The second factor is risk control. Central Bank credit and not open to business, only to leave the banks and financial institutions to use and relatively high cost for credit funds use.　　Based on this thinking, so the flashing white in November 2014, founded his own company, he would Flash white is defined as based on data analysis techniques, providing third party credit credit on account and payment solutions payment platform. A few days ago, flashed White has won the $ 5 million in angel investment.　　Flashing white-mainly providing different payment scenarios under the \"first, pay later\" service, who do not have credit on account and technical capacity of enterprises and credit payment solutions, which flashed white for third party guarantees, first commercial enterprise to complete payment, user is overdue, after staging the risk of bad debts borne by the flashing white, greatly reduces the risk of electrical enterprises. As a user, flashing white-the equivalent of a virtual credit card.　　As he put it, we\'re out of IT period to DT (Date Technology) era, the data will be an important asset for future business. Sheng Yang said, flashing white doing data mining of consumer finance, its data is derived from the following four parts:　　1, in the business of consumer behavior data.　　2, a Web crawler, and gets the user data over the Internet, including social networking site data.　　3, for the user to fill in some personal information, and by some technical means to verify the authenticity of the user.　　4, and other credit institutions and data agencies to cooperate.　　After the structure of these data through risk control model for blacklist filter, the user has a full range of portraits, and finally complete the overall assessment and scoring of this user.　　Led flashlight platform [Christmas Whitney CEO financial services rely](http://lvcase.blogspot.com/2016/04/christmas-whitney-ceo-financial.html)　　Take flowers go hand in hand is flashing white launched a credit product, users need to take goods to pay page to spend, you can choose to purchase the product, the term can be divided into 4:3, 6, 9 and 12.![Alt When the credit trends, flashing white-credit business of credit how to play?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7343/27727169081_8f6991d09c.jpg) 　　Flashing white-payment page　　Guo Zifang is flashing white-co-founder and CMO, she has served as a quick cash in North China Manager, Gao technology Deputy General Manager of the mobile phone payment and the accompanying financial Director, has over 10 years of financial experience in product design, marketing, and operations. She told TI media editing, Flash white is to work with businesses to conduct depth, the entire payment process embedded in the merchant\'s payment system, there is no jump and plug-in problems. In fact, both Taobao and is East of Beijing, the United States, they are paying a very high wastage rate in aspects of, up to a maximum of 20%. The reason, when the user goes shopping, and if you do not have a bank or third-party plug-ins are not be able to pay our invoice. In terms of user experience, jump will lose 10% of payment rates.　　As a partner, where network operations director Cai Changmao tells the reasons for cooperation with flashing white. Cai Changmao revealed, where to now, there are more than 900,000 orders per day, of which more than 100,000 failed orders, these failure orders, in addition to user information or order information is not accurate, but about 5%-10% is an order card balance is not enough. In addition, existing payment channels, required by the Bank for quick payment ceiling. While flashing white-this form of credit is to some extent compensate for Range Rover where the current flaws in the product and improve conversion rates.　　Remove outside there, said the introduction of Flash white and beautiful \"white beauty\" has also been launched. Sheng Yang told TI media editor now Flash white and include yintai network, Bell said, beautiful, net, scouring the world, Wan Jike, nearly 30 domestic e-commerce platform formed a partnership.　　Flash white outsiders care about profit model, Sheng Yang revealed that revenue comes from two parts, the first is for the e-commerce platform by providing financial services Commission income, but he also admits, Flash white or a startup company, and e-commerce commissions and the mode they haven\'t been pushed, mostly free. Staging of the second is to charge users fees, rates set different pricing based on the user\'s credit rating.　　In fact, consumer finance platform to credit to the user actually needs a lot of money, funds alone are not enough. If cooperation with the P2P platform can indeed solve the shortage of funds, but the higher interest rates will reduce the use of P2P credit product initiative. Flash white in on the sources of funding are more likely to cooperate with the e-commerce platform. Sheng Yang said most of the e-commerce platform have stranded capital, and seller\'s settlement because it is basically a month or more, this money does not produce any benefits, and if this money to activate, will bring benefits to users and producers.　　Internet consumer finance major players　　At present, already has many such consumer financial products on the market, many of whom like PayPal take Jingdong and eviscerated the Giants intervened. For flowers, Taobao and cats most of the shop operators or products will support the service, user confirmation before the 10th of the next month after receiving payment.
