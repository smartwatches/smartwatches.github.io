![Alt Virtual reality was born, why only now coming of spring?](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8761/28294621521_7cd1e55c28_z.jpg)Since the Oculus Rift on Kickstarter to raise successful, and its success has led to a large number of enterprises started to explore virtual reality, but its success also raises some doubts of the concept, why can now make virtual reality technology work?This is a problem deserving of study, you can look back over the past decades, you will see millions of virtual reality technology to develop public failures.Some people have expressed the view that \"has for decades had a lot of very smart people in the development of this technology, but why they did not achieve today\'s Oculus or other similar company structure? In 1995, the Virtual Boy does not want to buy this product, but in 2015, why would they buy Rift? ‚ÄùThis view ignores the most important technical factor: today\'s technology can really constitute a product.![Alt Virtual reality was born, why only now coming of spring?](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8627/28090571770_f45a77c800_z.jpg)Virtual reality 20 years ago look very badOculus equipment and products are a far cry from the past and a Rift, Oculus Rift has a higher pixel density LCD screen, gyroscopes and cameras for location tracking, and by means of a computer or phone like Gear VR can complete real-time rendering of 3D environments.All of these things benefit from technological advances in the different areas in recent decades, especially smart phones, and video games. And prices now compared to a few decades ago, will also allow consumers more receptive.Ten years ago, hardware manufacturers are likely to develop a virtual reality head-mounted devices and displays with a resolution higher than 1080P, please? Of course, except that it is too expensive for consumers, and it consumes portable devices so much power, so much so that in the case of no external extended battery packs cannot be sustained.

In 2003, a and above resolution screen sells for almost $ 8400, but the refresh rate of only 12 times per second. When the monitor power consumption is equivalent to a small desktop computer.Oculus launched the Developer Kit at the moment is Samsung Galaxy 1080P on S3 display, it can be refreshed 75 times per second. And Gear VR is Galaxy Note 4 loaded directly into the virtual reality headset, Note 4 is 1440P screen refresh speed more quickly.

Although studies show that virtual reality graphics do not need to be provided in \"real\", but these images have to be smooth. Lagging image to display if the image input, so in this case, move your head and look at you may lead to severe dizziness, destruction of user immersion in virtual reality. And the only thing we can do is to launch more powerful hardware and software code, which is just over the decades to hardware manufacturers and game developers are committed to work.

This is a whole new ecosystem, its appearance will make people develop appropriate interfaces and accessories around it, this will make virtual reality becoming real mainstream product.If you go to virtual reality rally or Oculus meeting, you will find a large number of developers are developing virtual reality applications what they think is right, these thoughts in a room full of cameras, to comprehensive monitoring of the treadmill and the Wii controller, developer ideas very much, but every idea is feasible?Six months from now, these developers will know which plans are feasible and what is not a viable option now. This sentence can also be in the last six months, even a year ago, Oculus landing Kickstarter, so to speak.via techcrunch
