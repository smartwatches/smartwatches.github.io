The GPU but we tend to ignore the Apple, Apple has always been on the GPU is doing very \"generous\", this time iPhone 5S said graphics performance is twice times the iPhone 5, iPhone 5S exist in the GFXBench site, the Apple \"silent seconds\" yet? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeGOVM-FtmE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeGOVM-FtmE) First look at the iPhone 5S GFXBench test scores, only version 2.5 of the two tests, one Offscreen (or 1080P) can reach 56 frame, Onscreen (that is, the original resolution) up to 53 frames. There are also a few \"unscientific\" place, under normal, low resolution should be high resolution results in a higher, but iPhone 5S, in contrast, presumably CPU frequency due to the instability.

OpenGL ES version 2.0, no more reach Apple\'s much-hyped on OpenGL ES 3.0, seems like iOS7 not ready.![Alt Who says Apple hardware?

So powerful GPU performance, just put it on 720P to the resolution, iPhone game 5S will be a major leap forward.![Alt Who says Apple hardware?

IPhone run 5S exposure](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8492/28165789874_85dd4d0514_b.jpg)Judging from the above, iPhone 5S result definitely called excellent, even in the face of today\'s most powerful Galaxy S4 LTE-A much, and iPad millet 3 version 4, TD at the same level. Apple claims \"twice times the graphics performance of\" has been largely demonstrated. Of course, this is just GFXBench 2.5 a test score and graphics processor capabilities on iPhone 5S conclusion we can\'t so soon.[![Alt Ted Baker iPhone 6 covers](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/i6/ted_baker_i6225_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/ted-baker-iphone-6-case-birdie-4-7-p-4066.html) IPhone 5S strategy is a witty, powerful combination of GPU is not high enough resolution, game performance will be stronger than the previous-generation iPhone 5 lots. High-end Android phones more powerful graphics performance, but want to go with 1080P screen optimization has always been coupled with iOS game advantage Android cell phone wants to challenge in the game too early to iOS. And prospects SoC development of iOS devices, Apple\'s strategy is to continuously improve the efficiency and speed of the CPU, GPU are crazy \"stacking\" State. The next generation iPad will certainly be big leap in GPU performance, perhaps we will soon see two times the SGX554MP4 Super GPU appears. Related articles:IPhone 5S brings us what?Live Apple product launches in the fall
