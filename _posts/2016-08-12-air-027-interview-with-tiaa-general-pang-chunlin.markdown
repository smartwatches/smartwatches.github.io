![Alt AIR 027 | Interview with TIAA General Pang Chunlin](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8032/28326385783_70a8d61462_b.jpg)Application telematics industry League Secretary General (TIAA) Pang Chunlin (left)Telematics Industry Association (TIAA), established in 2010, is made up of the Ministry of industry and information technology, Ministry of transport, Ministry of health, under the guidance of the national standardization Management Commission and other relevant departments, launched by the China electronics standardization Association.TIAA has three main lines of work: first, the development of standards; the second is capital cooperation, promote joint venture units; the third is patent, set up their own patent pool, for core patented binding. TIAA is a focus by targeting areas of cooperation with the industry, put together Union members, form an industrial chain upstream and downstream cooperation relationships, joint development of technology products and services in this area.August 12 to August 13 is Lei feng\'s network was held in Shenzhen CCF-GAIR global artificial intelligence and robot Summit from academia and industry meeting in Shenzhen, the top representative of sharing in their respective areas of latest developments and thinking. Pang Chunlin was invited to participate in this Summit, this is Lei Feng network interview with him, which is his view on the understanding of networking and smart cars and cars.What kinds of companies in the automotive sector is competitive?Lei feng\'s network: TIAA since its establishment in 2010, after six years of development, you also saw the changes in the field of telematics and vehicle networking. As a witness, you find any change and growth in this area?Pang Chunlin: the biggest change is that the Government\'s approach to new technology companies and business models. NET about cars, the Government has fully liberalized.Second is absorbing more of the industry to pay attention to this area, such as manufacturing or other industries across the Internet community, and of course there are some gimmicks. Tell IT to subvert, not subversion, is integration. We always speak of industrialization and Informationization integration, Internet +, is actually the fusion of electronic information with the industry, so it brought many industries transition to this area.The third change is that six years ago, we set up the intelligent vehicle standards, automotive software, technology and other advanced technical standards. There was a suspicious attitude, I feel not so fast. But now the market is very hot.From technical reserves, many technology six years ago may be a weakness, still is. On the surface it seems a lot of people, in fact, there are technology gaps, for example, embedded software of intelligent vehicle systems is also not a few units are doing, information security weaknesses.Lei feng\'s network: technical reserves or technical pattern, six years ago, did not change much, even weak, you are considered to be investment, technical ability or some other reason?Pang Chunlin: any industrial growth requires some environment and development time. Such as smart cars from several large technology: integrated circuits, software, and communications. Integrated circuit and software now is the short Board. General technology has failed, smart cars are gaps and weaknesses in these two areas.Now for Internet communication technology, such as 5G, haven\'t began to gain ground. Now we are short in chips, software and high technology devices. Why technical changes are unlikely, because China breakthrough progress in these three areas are not particularly large.These few short Board of challenge is also very good, less technical barriers are higher than consumer electronics. If the consumer electronics we break, in automotive electronics, we are going to face challenges in the field of intelligent vehicle may be greater. So now we see more in auto driving or ADAS algorithm fuss.Lei feng\'s network: how to change this pattern?Pang Chunlin: this is more complex, and the industry as a whole, investment-related. Money is a vital element, but not voted for money, what we will be able to output. And policy, the environment, and so on.China is the world\'s countries with the highest research funding, probably trillions of Yuan a year. But the quality of our scientific and technological achievements and the United States than there is still a certain gap. So the money just to make up for research and development of a short Board, but was lacking in talent or other things.Lei feng\'s network: do you think what kind of company is core and competitive in this field?Pang Chunlin: an innovative and new vehicle concept vehicle will continue to be the basis of the industry in the future, can make the vehicle model will change, now many depots are designed to produce, will most likely just taking orders, became a factory.Parts and components manufacturers and electronic information fusion, new modular enterprise will be long term. So-called modular production enterprises, such as anti-lock braking system is purely mechanical, now with ECU, electronic control and algorithms. That is not now destined, destined into intelligent manufacturers probably will become a major force in the future.Industrial software and embedded software, algorithms to do business. Many businesses need in future embedded systems, algorithms like humans \"thinking\" so that each system and components into intelligent, software and this will also be reflected in the car, but hardware and bound together to form a complete system. And 2nd is actually closely related.And telematics, smart new information related to the provision of information services business will grow up like Ali (in cooperation with SAIC) is actually to obtain more information, in fact, is providing a new information service. Current information may be obtained from the portal or mobile phone, might have in the future vehicles feature more obvious services, new car service operator may be.Car service markets, including repair and maintenance may be a new batch of enterprises, subversive original, there are some business models or modes.Future of China\'s InternetLei feng\'s network: the development of Internet in China compared with foreign countries at this stage, what is the position?Pang Chunlin: from technical reserves and scientific research, China still has its own certain characteristics. Because from the 80 \'s we began doing research in this area. Unmanned us for 30 years, also has its own characteristics. But overall, China and Europe, gaps larger than is hardware, software, very hot.Involving service, China\'s varied, such as parking, car wash, car service than the external, which is characteristic of China. China\'s online retail transactions is also the world\'s largest, Europe is still traditional, profitable but not much, because the business model is not obvious, are burning money.

For example, Visual, and Mobileye are made around the world.Lei feng\'s network: China telematics to the areas in which development in the future? What kind of future do you think it is?Pang Chunlin: I think that the future developments have the potential to drive or new services will lead to breakthroughs. NET, for example about, we first recognize network around the world about the car.From another perspective, the Government is very supportive. So I think China in application environments and applications may be leading in Europe and North America, the Government will create a better environment. We support Baidu unmanned model zone in Wuhu and Wuzhen, baic in panjin area, so the Government\'s support in this regard, policies may be more advanced.[![Alt VR Box headset](http://www.everweek.com/images/large/virtual_reality/3d_headset_vr004_lrg.jpg)](http://www.everweek.com/vr-box-virtual-reality-headset-for-smart-phone-p-2838.html)We may be fast in telematics applications, some niche, I think China may outshine. Because an important part of driving a car is automatically involved in information security, so in the future, navigation, map and information modules on special, must be a Chinese enterprise of the world, so why do we support Baidu, Gaud, navinfo, the Big Dipper, because it is impossible to open to foreign investment to do so.Smart driving and telematics [VR box 3D headset](http://designercase2.blogspot.com/2016/08/white-paper-on-his-headphones-2013-by.html)Lei feng\'s network: for nearly a year, everyone was talking about smart driving, what do you think about unmanned or autonomous changes to human life in the future?Pang Chunlin: Automatic drive popularity, can have a large impact: changing the architecture of social ecological chain and labour. It is machines to replace people. This may lead to relatively large impact, but why does autopilot do? Because the autopilot could ground transportation \"disorder\" to \"order\". Such as high-speed rail, aircraft or ship, in a sense, also called an orderly driving.Now only one of the most irregular mode of transportation is the ground land transport, accidents, power loss caused by many every year. Autopilot can bring: security, energy, environmental protection and efficiency. This is an automated driving change, its contribution to the future of human life is so great that it is benefits.Of course it brings employment issues will be resolved through other means, this is the law of development of human history: a lot of farmers out of the industrial revolution, society continues to move forward and create wealth. Any technology, as long as the wealth creation, from the simple sense, that in itself is a good thing.Lei feng\'s network (search for \"Lei feng\'s network\", public interest)-from the common cars in the process of transition to a smart car, what do you think this is one of the most critical?Pang Chunlin: the first is reliability, sufficient to prove reliable than human drivers driving the machine. The second is cost. Cost is cheap enough, applications will more and more. Google CEO of unmanned vehicles and we talked, and he thinks this is what Moore\'s law: the efficiency gains 1 time every two years, the price fell by half.Reliability solution cost down, closer and closer to universal. In specific areas, such as trucks and other commercial vehicles would be faster to be applied.Lei feng\'s network: How do you feel about smart cars and connectivity relationship?Pang Chunlin: we proposed, smart car, smart highways are a fulcrum, pivot is to produce information, creating information, and delivery information. Only the fulcrum, telematics will make sense.Connectivity is actually dependent on communication technologies, Fulcrum linked together these, so they are relations between points and lines, a number of points and lines together, forming a surface--this is the vehicle information services.Lei feng\'s network: 2014-you made a speech, saying future Smart cars will go to the four modernizations: Intelligent Sensing, software integration, high speed of transmission and environmental interactions. Now, two years later, do you think this trend has been developing the kind of degree?Pang Chunlin: now at this stage to go. Environmental interactions haven\'t started, because it must have reliable communications, 5G not apply now, so the environment interaction was still not commonplace, including smart roads and no.Software integration now includes direction more, now more and more automotive software began to develop modular software. There is a view that is now about seven thousand or eight thousand chips in the car; another perspective is universal chip operating system may not need so many chips in the future, a chip can manage a lot of ECU, called SOC.For now, SAIC and Ali is a case of cooperation, in-car terminals, its computing power and features are actually more powerful than traditional machines operation.Lei feng\'s network: in this wave of intelligent vehicle, do you think the future is auto manufacturer-driven or technology-the technology company leading?Pang Chunlin: carrier of OEM auto makers will be in the future. New technology will continue to play.Building cars in the future will the emergence of a new trend: personalized automobile. I think the depot the right to speak may not be as high. Now more than more than 100 OEMs, itself of excess capacity. Many depots will become OEM partners in the future.Personalized booking not like mass production car times. Personalized set cars became popular in Europe and America. Industrial 4.0 is so defined, factory processing aspect. Future profits must be in processing the link. But now vehicle design, production and sales as a whole, the space is one of the largest master of profits, sales and design are separate in the future, such as online sales after design can be outsourced. Both changes could bring certain OEMs to change.
