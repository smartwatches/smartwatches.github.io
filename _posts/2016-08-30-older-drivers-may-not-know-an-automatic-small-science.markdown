Fans recently to make a message says, he always open is a manual transmission car, recently bought a automatic transmission, which are all open for almost a month, automatic file still didn\'t quite understand that. That small series of today will give you knowledge about science-related. Well, little white left, old drivers the trouble of automatic detour on their own!![Alt Older drivers may not know an automatic, small science! ](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8515/29255992231_1710a6bd43.jpg)Automatic transmission has the following gear: p Block: stop. Parking needed to hang the block p Block, idling stop can hang on for a long time on the p-block. R Block: reverse gear. Back when hanging on the r Block block. N block: neutral. This manual is a meaning of space, parking can be hung in the air for a short time on the block. D block: forward gear. Hanging on in this gear vehicles will move on, on this gear, gearbox depending on vehicle speed and throttle in automatic switching between 1 to top gear.![Alt Older drivers may not know an automatic, small science! ](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8737/29256000371_0ba5a31b62_z.jpg)Digital block: some automatic transmission models below the d block will be 3, 2, 13 numbers, they also represent forward gears, gear restrictions are three different. 3 represents the shift is limited to 1 between gear 3 gear, primarily used when overtaking. 2 represents the shift is limited to 1 between gear and 2 gear, mainly on wet pavement or a slow start when the speed of use. 1 represents the shift is limited to 1 gear, torque to use when needed, mainly in climbing.![Alt Older drivers may not know an automatic, small science! ](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8208/29301365846_8e11f9fd64_z.jpg)S gear: sports mode. When after hanging into the s-block, transmission shift would delay so that gear at high speeds to maintain a longer period of time, increase the power, but gas is inevitable.![Alt Older drivers may not know an automatic, small science! ](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8533/28711860374_41549e6702_z.jpg)M block: manual mode. When after hanging into the m block, shifting need driver manual to complete. We often see Royal saloon models will appear near the gear lever \"+\" \"-\" the two symbols \"+\" number represents the rising block that \"-\" number represents the downshift, and some models use a plectrum shift and location at the bottom of the steering wheel, about each one.![Alt Older drivers may not know an automatic, small science! ](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8363/28713976903_075cdbd55d_z.jpg)L block: low gear. The figures given above and retaining the \"1\" is a mean, are designed to limit at the lowest gear, instead of rising in order to get high torque gears.![Alt Older drivers may not know an automatic, small science! ](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8424/29256024061_de2d0dc160_z.jpg)II using automatically car type of note matters driving in the don\'t hanging n document glide Dang driving in the put document bit put in n above Shi, pump is cannot normal to for oil for lubrication of, and automatically gearbox within and need lubrication, so such will makes gearbox within parts temperature increased, caused completely damaged! addition, high-speed driving Shi if gap glide, also easy caused resonance and skid phenomenon, not only not province oil, also very dangerous!Â ![Alt Older drivers may not know an automatic, small science! ](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8558/29301405406_9edf258098_z.jpg)N gear trailer when we all know that many vehicle specifications are defined: hanging on the n block block when the trailer, towing speed should not exceed 50km/h, and some models are 30km/h, the distance does not exceed 50km. Xiao bian suggest you comply with these requirements, because automatic after their car breaks down, the engine does not work, hydraulic torque converter does not turn, ATF oil pump not working, ATF cycle is stopped, cooling problems are likely to arise.

But must the car stopped it again into the p-Block, or cause a lot of damage to the transmission. If flat parking for a long time, you can use the p-Block locking, hand brake auxiliary. And when ramp parking, to avoid vehicle vibration into p gear directly, stopped the car, hang n---p gear song brake pull handbrake------.![Alt Older drivers may not know an automatic, small science! ](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8311/29301419476_d87ddfed53_z.jpg)Short-term parking while waiting for the traffic light, n + gear + Handbrake or d the brake lines, if parking more than half a minute, n gear you\'d pull handbrake.Small series of saying this article is prepared for those who are not familiar with the small automatic transmission shift literacy articles for owners, for seniors to drive automatic transmission cars, small might be a little swim! Well ... Just don\'t spray! Meanwhile, superiors who have good experience to share with small white, welcome in the comments below!
