Bull\'s head to the demon King\'s road to change](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5441/30736330805_dd2dbfae0a_b.jpg)      In recent years, Toyota\'s design does not know is how, more and more exaggerated, more and more radical. Whether it\'s own brand of low-end models, and still fight for the high-end Lexus, calm and restrained further away with it.      Today I talk to all Toyota from Dr bull to the demon King\'s road of evolution:![Alt Toyota?

Do this or do you have an image of Toyota?      To say these vehicles, ten years ago, say they are quite literally concept car, the low-key era, concept cars and production cars are completely different from, at most, a slight reference to the concept car features.      But now Toyota exaggerated concept car is called a 6, not only 100% replica, even capable of 120% work.LF-A      In 2005, Lexus released LF-A first edition concept car      In 2010, when production eventually dumped ten concept concept cars LF-A Street      Do you think Lexus has stopped? NONONO, not so foreign body milk, afterwards it concept cars and production cars have almost no difference between:LF-CCISLF-NXNXOf course, the dream to say that following the Dr let me dream of themselves big American cars:LC500LF-LCLC500This year\'s Beijing auto show when I saw it I had HIWatched a high-end brand Lexus play 6, Toyota also held live, painting styles began to change:C-HRC-HR concept cars [Today the car smell 2 day 6 clusters new listing](http://www.evertiny.com/2016/10/07/today-the-car-smell-2-day-6-clusters-new-listing-the-corolla-accord-hybrid-version/)C-HR production carS-FR      Positioned below the Toyota 86, is an introduction to trot, 1.5T+6MT, body size and MX-5 close, so kawaii style is not known whether mass production, but for urine to Toyota in recent years, this car I think definitely worth it! [Today the car smell 2 day 6 clusters new listing](http://www.evertiny.com/2016/10/07/today-the-car-smell-2-day-6-clusters-new-listing-the-corolla-accord-hybrid-version/)FT-1 concept      This is one of Toyota\'s highly anticipated models, is said to be likely to be, and the Nissan GTR, Honda NSX, Mazda RX-7 par SUPRA successor models, will be sharing Powertrain and BMW M3/M4, there will be a hybrid launch Edition models. Now this dude has been on New Zealand\'s North tested, 2017 coming soon, I\'m sure this face will continue.JIXIE      Of course there are certainly not mass production of designer pieces      Having seen so many cars, how do you feel about Toyota\'s appearance changes? I was surprised by Toyota\'s changes, now it\'s better than France\'s design avant-garde, than Italy\'s style is still wild, and it is from Japan\'s Toyota.
