Not cannot be used.Screen:NEXUS 9 of screen details performance is good, but real let we surprised of is this block screen of color restore capacity, regardless of is actual perception also is we measurement get of numerical are is was impression deep of, in parameter aspects, this block screen of size for 8.9 inches, 1536x2048 of resolution let this block screen of resolution reached has 288ppi, although with Samsung Galaxy Tab s 8.4 of 359ppi also somewhat gap, but in normal using of when, This screen has no obvious sense of particles.Screen\'s maximum brightness reached 453 nits, gamma value reaches the very best 2.17, color temperature of 6942K, generally very accurate color, these parameters are also easily beat iPad Air 2 and the Samsung Galaxy Tab s 8.4 and the screen even under direct sunlight outdoors you can clearly display the content.Viewing angle, NEXUS 9 screen performance remains good, in the IPS screen is fine.Color and gray-scale performance as well, black to move.In addition to the excellent test data, this screen look very good, clear, wide viewing angle, accurate color reproduction, we comment on the screen, it is only \"good top like\" three little words.System:The benchmark as an Android tablet, NEXUS 9 nature is clean running the latest Android system 5.0, and the moment we launched NEXUS 9 enters the system, emitted by the new system booming all around it, as the first shipment of Android Tablet 5.0, NEXUS 9 in operation, as well as Visual effects, are a whole new level.5.0 system can say is too much, for the sake of space also will select a few to really have on the user experience significantly.First, Google from Android l began on introduced has new of \"Material Design\", and from Visual angle Shang view, whole interface of UI was again design, and completely flat of, removed has not necessary of details, created has history Shang most simple of Android UI, notification project was very intuitive to displayed in screen of most top layer, and from APP of icon to set interface in of icon also after again design and again arranged, a sentence words for, new of UI is too beauty has.In terms of function, 5.0 again ahead of iOS, and in some cases 5.0 system operation even more easily than Windows 8.1 5.0 new features is that notifications can be classified according to priority, so when we received a notification, the system will give priority to display important notifications. And we lock screen notifications for 5.0 interface is like a plus, because simply double click on the lock screen notifications will be able to directly launch the corresponding application.

The disadvantage is that for those who shake hands, NEXUS 9 photos of the success rate is not high enough, it is easy to make Paste.
